# üéØ Final Setup Steps

## What You Need to Copy

You need to copy **ONE** of these files (TypeScript version is better):

### ‚úÖ **RECOMMENDED: Copy the TypeScript file**

This gives you full type safety and IntelliSense!

**FROM:**
```
/workspaces/Arcanecast/voting/target/types/voting.ts
```

**TO:**
```
/workspaces/Arcanecast/voting/app/src/types/voting.ts
```

---

### Alternative: Use JSON (if TypeScript doesn't work)

**FROM:**
```
/workspaces/Arcanecast/voting/target/idl/voting.json
```

**TO:**
```
/workspaces/Arcanecast/voting/app/target/types/voting.json
```

Then revert the service import to:
```typescript
import VotingIDL from "../../target/types/voting.json";
```

## Why TypeScript Version is Better

| Feature | voting.ts | voting.json |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Type Safety** | ‚úÖ Full types | ‚ùå Manual typing |
| **IntelliSense** | ‚úÖ Auto-complete | ‚ùå Limited |
| **Compile Checks** | ‚úÖ Catch errors early | ‚ùå Runtime errors |
| **Import** | `import { Voting }` | `import IDL from` |
| **Usage** | `Program<Voting>` | `Program<any>` |

## After Copying

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd app
   npm install
   ```

2. **Create environment file:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

3. **Run development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Quick Test

Once running:
1. Connect wallet (top-right)
2. Wait for "Encryption ready!" toast
3. Click "Create Poll"
4. Enter poll ID and question
5. Create and vote!

## Troubleshooting

### Import Errors
If you see "Cannot find module '@/types/voting'":
- Make sure you copied `voting.ts` to the correct location
- Restart the dev server (`npm run dev`)
- Check the file path is exactly: `app/src/types/voting.ts`

### Type Errors
If you get TypeScript errors:
- The TypeScript file from Anchor is pre-configured
- No manual typing needed!
- Just copy and it works
